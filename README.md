# Sidekiq CloudWatch Metrics

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/sj26/sidekiq-cloudwatchmetrics.svg)](https://travis-ci.org/sj26/sidekiq-cloudwatchmetrics)

Runs a thread inside your Sidekiq processes to report metrics to CloudWatch
useful for autoscaling and keeping an eye on your queues.

Optimised for Sidekiq Enterprise with leader election, but works everywhere!

## Installation

Add this gem to your applicationâ€™s Gemfile near sidekiq and then run `bundle install`:

```ruby
gem "sidekiq"
gem "sidekiq-cloudwatchmetrics"
```

## Usage

Add near your Sidekiq configuration, like in `config/initializers/sidekiq.rb` in Rails:

```ruby
require "sidekiq"
require "sidekiq/cloudwatchmetrics"

Sidekiq::CloudWatchMetrics.enable!
```

By default this assumes you're running on an EC2 instance with an instance role
that can publish CloudWatch metrics, or that you've supplied AWS credentials
through environment variables that aws-sdk expects. You can also explicitly
supply an [aws-sdk CloudWatch Client instance][cwclient]:

```ruby
Sidekiq::CloudWatchMetrics.enable!(client: Aws::CloudWatch::Client.new)
```

  [cwclient]: https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sdk-for-ruby/v3/api/Aws/CloudWatch/Client.html

The default namespace for metrics is "Sidekiq". You can configure this with the `namespace` option:

```ruby
Sidekiq::CloudWatchMetrics.enable!(client: Aws::CloudWatch::Client.new, namespace: "Sidekiq-Staging")
```

By default, each process will emit a `Utilization` metric with the hostname and
tag as dimensions, and then an average `Utilization` metric is omitted as an
autoscaling target. If you don't want the per-process metrics then htey can be
turned off:

```ruby
Sidekiq::CloudWatchMetrics.enable!(client: Aws::CloudWatch::Client.new, process_metrics: false)
```

## Development

After checking out the repo, run `bin/setup` to install dependencies. Then, run `rake spec` to run the tests. You can also run `bin/console` for an interactive prompt that will allow you to experiment.

To install this gem onto your local machine, run `bundle exec rake install`. To release a new version, update the version number in `version.rb`, and then run `bundle exec rake release`, which will create a git tag for the version, push git commits and tags, and push the `.gem` file to [rubygems.org](https://rubygems.org).
